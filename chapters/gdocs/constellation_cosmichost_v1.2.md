# ASI, evolution and the Cosmic Host

# TL;DR

In this post I unpack the assumption ladder behind Nick Bostrom’s “cosmic host” and “cosmic norms”. He argues that humans, and any ASIs we create, should defer to the preferences of any cosmic host. However, it appears that these concepts depend on how we think about the physical/cognitive/social shape of aliens; whether our version of philosophical rationality would apply to many or most aliens; and whether ASI motivations are actually convergent (on a large scale normative structure). Are these justified? The astrobiology literature is mostly ambiguous on what aliens are like. Evolutionary biology points at a wide scope of ”rationality” on Earth, much of which maps only weakly to human norms. Human norms and values, which the alignment discourse generally seeks to preserve into the indefinite future, have a non-obvious claim to being useful in radically different ASI-dominated worlds.  Lastly, the idea of cosmic norms invites us to ask how an ASI would determine its terminal goals, something that isn’t even clear in the human case. These complications suggest that we need to develop Bostrom’s idea further, before regarding them as action-guiding for ASI development. I end by sketching out possible LLM-based investigations to get some empirical traction on these questions.

Aside from the sections below, Appendix 2 might be of interest as a consolidated list of LLM-generated questions about Bostrom’s papers.

*Epistemic status: This post is an attempt to understand Bostrom's argument, which in both papers is presented as a nested hierarchy of points rather than fully fleshed out/referenced. This is also the starting point for research I plan to do in the next few weeks. I may have misinterpreted parts of, or the overall thrust of, his papers, so comments are welcome \!*

# Why is this important?

Most writing on AGI/ASI has focused on downside risks; far less has asked what ASI should be aimed toward (besides “not kill everyone”).[^1] Partly that’s epistemic humility: we’re unlikely to foresee the goals of a much smarter system; partly it is a pragmatic choice: even pre-AGI systems pose substantial risks and opportunities, hence deserve the most focus. Still, if short timelines are proven right, we can’t ignore the post-AGI question. In that context, Nick Bostrom’s *cosmic host* idea (a putative community of advanced civilisations whose norms we ought to follow) is an important framing document.

The cosmic host idea appears to assume that some version of rationality would be a common feature of intelligent agents (aliens/ETIs or AIs), and the desire of (sufficiently powerful) ETIs to seek influence or colonise large volumes of spacetime. The idea of the norms members of the cosmic host might hold also re-activates an old question in alignment and longtermism: how would an ASI set its own terminal goals?[^2] 

Although not the principal focus of this post (see future work), the cosmic host paper also has an implicit political aspect: it argues for making progress towards aligned ASI with any pauses being carefully undertaken because certain types of pauses risk becoming long-term or permanent freezes/halts. This is directly relevant to the [FLI superintelligence](https://superintelligence-statement.org/) quasi-ban.

# Assumption ladder

Bostrom’s working papers ([AI Creation and the Cosmic Host](https://nickbostrom.com/papers/ai-creation-and-the-cosmic-host.pdf?__readwiseLocation=) (abbrev. CH2024) and the related [Base Camp for Mt. Ethics](https://nickbostrom.com/papers/mountethics.pdf) (ME2022)) can be summarised as: 

* the cosmic host is ‘an entity or set of entities whose preferences and concordats dominate at the largest scale, i.e. that of the cosmos…\[which is\] meant to include the multiverse and whatever else is contained in the totality of existence…\[such as\] galactic-scale civilisations, simulators, superintelligences, and/or a divine being or beings’[^3]  
* if a cosmic host exists (probably the case because of simulation, large/infinite cosmos, or multiverse flavoured arguments);   
* and if this host can converge around certain cosmic norms (for ontogenic, simulation, or game-theoretic reasons);   
* and if sufficiently capable intelligences can infer those norms;   
* then there are prudential, epistemic and moral reasons for humans to conform to them. 


Relatedly, he argues that ASI would be especially able to discover and inclined to comply with the norms, which is why designing a good “cosmic citizen” matters.

We can rewrite his arguments as: 

(0) **Rationality** is a useful foundation for thinking about ASI and ETIs  
(i) **Existence**: technologically mature civilisations (i.e. candidates for cosmic host membership) exist  
(ii) **Coordination**: at least some such civilisations can coordinate at scale  
(iii) **Preferences**: they have stable, large-scope (e.g. cosmic) preferences  
(iv) **Normativity**: some such preferences are morally binding or prudentially recommended for us  
(v) **Discoverability**: these preferences are discoverable by ASI

I’ll start by examining the background assumption of rationality in arbitrarily capable AI or alien minds. Next, I’ll review sources from astrobiology and evolutionary biology that make us question the idea of norm formation. I then look at the complexity of value from the perspective of humanities-aligned philosophers, in order to argue that norms (our own or those of alien/ASI civilisations, will depend on their form-of-being). Finally, I discuss possible empirical and conceptual investigations on frontier and pre-AGI systems that could help make progress on these issues.

# Rationality in the space-of-minds

*TL;DR: To what extent do Bostrom's arguments depend upon a shared understanding of what rationality means across the space of possible minds? I consider 3 types of “rationality”: ecological, economic/game-theoretic, and morality. Relatedly, what does the term “human values” (the indefinite preservation of which is the avowed aim of most AI alignment/safety/ethics people) connote, over and above these conceptions of rationality?*

The idea of humans as apex species owing to our capacity for reason has long been critiqued in [biology and social sciences](https://awake-spring-b0d.notion.site/PIBBSS-Library-85765b0c0ce644cebf09fef1ec56d904), and in [early](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09469) / [recent](https://reflectivealtruism.com/tag/power-seeking-theorems/) [writing](https://tu8umwhbb.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001a-8fo6wX6xPnA4GoTcrhCiZZMajAwcW5J4RpzyNQCCOtzBfrWpmfmQwq8GqdDQOGUfgtkk9bXUkXcU3sVzEjpInbiPSaviEVLHLuV_DjUS6-6okF6jnGTZcofUmSMgYjo_cN7v_0l6YZo6C6hcM4dH3gY8p4MKJEE6o4IP-IElgRjOrhptWNOrXbh-wRpMJS2MnjYXQJdVWA2WqTuBrGXmsBCwOCbWrQIcKMAeXlN7A=&c=uC-xccyEY6hAGa8qNVJg6IBWiKIIz1sdefeXYOe2axmPlJ6t9BBXQA==&ch=W5lb4zX_PO1u6UyHPKxHJzgy5Buc8peR_affci2gE_Rw0Hrh2tRnpw==) on alignment’s basic concepts (such as [instrumental](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-024-02129-3) [convergence](https://philarchive.org/rec/SHAPOA-3)).

Against this backdrop, I can see three possible formulations of rationality being invoked to describe the cognition of the cosmic host’s members: ecological, game-theoretic, and philosophical.[^4] Having a clear idea of how these formulations interact in AI-relevant ways is upstream of understanding Bostrom’s papers, if (as I assume) the cosmic host/norms argument’s force relies on a convergence towards not just intelligence, but towards philosophical rationality as a foundation for morality.[^5]  

## Ecological/game-theoretic rationality 

Earth shows many forms of intelligence adapted to specific niches, and such niche-adaptation is referred to as "ecological rationality". We see intelligent-looking behaviour being common in nonhuman life, such as in swarms/colonies, slime mould, mycelium, viruses (and other organisms that hijack a host’s action-guiding mechanism), as well as distributed cephalopod cognition.[^6] 

As a refinement of this ecological framing, there is also a game-theoretic version of rationality: the widespread emergence of cooperative behaviour that, at least shallowly, resembles some human moral norms.[^7] This overwhelming pattern suggests cooperation is neither an evolutionary accident, nor something associated with higher intelligence, but a fundamental low-level computational solution to certain environmental challenges.[^8] 

However, such functional, evolutionarily selected-for versions of rationality are autopoietic tools for survival; they don’t carry much of the baggage of what some humans say they value (things some might find distinctively human like “love”, “caring for”, “appreciating beauty”, “finding things funny”).[^9] 

## A minimal morality for large worlds?

How can we get from ecological or game theoretical rationality to rationality-as-morality, which might be idiosyncratic to biological organisms found on Earth? How can we reason about intelligences of arbitrary shape, existing in a potentially very different environment? This probably can’t be answered in the abstract, without knowing the evolutionary or training process that entity has undergone; but perhaps there could be a minimal set that is likely to be broadly useful and therefore selectively favoured (what I call a Minimal Large World Subset or MLS, defined below):[^10]

**Epistemic fidelity**: An entity should maintain accurate, updateable world-models, and avoid self-deception.  
**Impartiality**: It should accord non-zero, scale-sensitive moral weight to all moral patients[^11]  
**S-risk priority**: It should aim to minimise extreme suffering, with reductions in severe suffering as being more important than gains in mild pleasure.[^12]  
**Large-world cooperation**: Where there is non-negligible causal, logical or evidential coupling with peers, it should pursue Pareto-efficient compromise.[^13]  
**Caution**: It should prefer reversible options, avoid lock-in and  penalise irreversible value destruction.

## The Fun Remainder

*TL;DR: “Human values” are hard to talk about; trying to extend Eliezer's notion of fun and complexity/fragility of value with perspectives from the humanities/aesthetics.*

If we assume that many evolved and designed intelligences would be ecologically rational, and some would have something (i.e. representations or decision-relevant beliefs) broadly like the MLS, what is left over from the set of things referred to as “human values”? 

Would we still have the problem identified by [Yudkowsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/9bvAELWc8y2gYjRav/p/GNnHHmm8EzePmKzPk) of a dull experience-machine or meaningless tiling of the lightcone, because some complex notion of “interestingness” or novelty never was sufficiently favoured in the selection process, and so didn’t show up in the set of preferences? Call whatever is being referred to as distinctly human (that isn’t captured in the ecological, game-theoretic, moral rationality taxonomy above), the “Fun Remainder” (FR). 

What might be in the FR? As [Yudkowsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K4aGvLnHvYgX9pZHS/the-fun-theory-sequence) and his [commentators](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/r6p5cqT6aWYGCYHJx/review-of-but-exactly-how-complex-and-fragile?utm_source=chatgpt.com) point out, it is hard to produce a list of the aspects of human life that one might be upset to find weren’t present in a bad or unaligned ASI future.[^14] But we get some indication in “[31 Laws of Fun](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qZJBighPrnv9bSqTZ/31-laws-of-fun)” and “[Complexity of Value](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/complexity-of-value)”, which highlights ongoing (often uncompletable) things like agency and self-authorship, meaningful challenge and growth  friendship, novelty, discovery, sentience and sensory experience, relationships and the lifelong pursuit of  skillful (both physical and mental) self-directed as well as shared projects that are undertaken in communities. Other items include a world that is scaled appropriately for human psychology, one with non-trivial goods (i.e. no experience machines), and a sense of freedom.

### Fun as aesthetics and process

This rich conception of the FR maps well onto philosophy, particularly that of aesthetics/art, and (in the EA conversation around moral realism) resonates with the idea of [trajectory-based](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/R8vKwpMtFQ9kDvkJQ/p/8D9qsmGEdKsrfGEHw#:~:text=Adopting%20an%20optimization,role%20model%E2%80%99s%20thoughts\).) life goals.[^15] 

To take three examples: Alva Noë, Kieran Setiya, and Helen de Cruz, albeit with different emphases, prioritise *process* over outcome, where the process of knowledge formation often operates at multiple levels of self-reflective abstraction, and (not surprisingly, given that they are talking about humans) is often *embodied, sensory, communal and practice-based*. 

* Setiya distinguishes atelic versus telic activities, where the former have no clear goal that can be “completed”, while the latter do and are enjoyable in their [ongoingness](https://aeon.co/ideas/how-schopenhauers-thought-can-illuminate-a-midlife-crisis) (and this ongoingness, understood as “doing” or “practice” is itself an important source of [knowledge](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/practical-knowledge-9780190462925?cc=gb&lang=en&#)). This implies a rich account of what experience’s value to humans actually is, and why many people have the intuition that the experience machine (or hedonium-type tilings/wireheading) would be unsatisfactory.   
* De Cruz points to human emotions like wonder and [awe](https://helendecruz.net/docs/DeCruz_awe_wonder.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com), which she cites as the reason scientific or philosophical progress even starts (i.e. early humans marvelling at the regularity of the sunrise and sunset). In her account, absent awe and wonder, humans would never have had goals to improve their epistemics.   
* Noë identifies activities that are durational and (often) not primarily directed at a goal, like children’s [play](https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/action-in-perception/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) or [art](https://philarchive.org/archive/ALPBRQ?utm_source=chatgpt.com), as vital for organising attention and in building cooperative/competitive social skills.


### Fun: biological baggage promoted as The Good

However, one could object that the FR-shaped things being described above ultimately cash out as evolved biological control mechanisms that are particular to fragile, individually weak, and short-lived humans.  These limitations created a capability niche or lack, that evolution filled rather well: humans developed ways of [poking](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/loewenstein/PsychofCuriosity.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [at](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627315007679?utm_source=chatgpt.com) the world through [play](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273229706000633?utm_source=chatgpt.com); [motivating](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8205159/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [themselves](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/ieeecreative.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) to explore and learn in environments with [sparse](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.10546) rewards; and [coordinating](https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/Intellectual_Life/Frank_Status_of_Moral_Reasoning.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) based upon shared prelinguistic and linguistic understandings of the world. These biological mechanisms were subsequently [promoted](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Zm7WAJMTaFvuh2Wc7/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success?utm_source=chatgpt.com) or [reified](https://closertotruth.com/news/helen-de-cruz-wonderstruck/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) in various cultures (through religion, myth, tribalism, as well as the modern educational system) into notions of “the good”: things important in their own right, perhaps even things to be preserved across the lightcone. However, it is less clear why the items above would apply to (say) digital [minds](https://nickbostrom.com/propositions.pdf) which can introspect well; communicate transparently; change their physical/mental form and be copied; exist at larger/smaller [spatiotemporal](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5XjrEr8c8z6tTHDF2/stratified-utopia-2) scales; simulate better; and don’t necessarily have a “childhood” or an awareness of “death”. 

Are Eliezer-flavoured concerns (that a lightcone-without-fun would be somehow cosmically terrible) more like special pleading for our particular form-of-life?[^16] That is, such concerns could be an example of [Milan Ćirković's](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.1821) observation about METI/SETI: transhumanist-inflected posthumanism (which is adjacent and historically relevant for alignment and longtermism) seems to recognise and welcome radical technological change (in our biology and technological affordances) while retaining preferences, values, and norms that were evolved for biological beings in a specific environment.[^17]

Put another way, for an arbitrary intelligence, does having the FR matter for capability (does lacking it degrade exploration, goal-finding, or long-horizon self-correction)? For the universe as-a-whole, does it matter axiologically (is a future without FR worse by our lights, and if so, is there any further justification for this worseness and who is the “our” in this evaluation)?[^18] 

### Whence terminal goals?

A provocation (from philosopher Peter Wolfendale) is that FR-shaped attributes are what is needed for intelligent entities to *set* their terminal goals (i.e. the Ladder’s “Preferences”, ”Normativity” rungs).[^19] His perspective foundationally distinguishes between what an agent *must* do and what it *may* do, suggesting that the locus of terminal ends lies in aesthetic capacity, understood as the pursuit of excellence beyond necessity.[^20] 

On this view, ethics concerns what one morally ought to do; aesthetics concerns what one *may* choose to do, if one is not under any obligation. So aesthetics is the practice by which agents set and progressively modify or elaborate their terminal ends. In AI terms, we can think of this as open-ended exploration of possibilities, as well as the formation and revision of coherent preferences (when preferences are not given from outside, as they usually are currently with RLs or LLMs). In humans, such preferences are learned in life and culture on a genetic substrate (and sometimes through reflective reasoning or heuristics); they are often [opaque](https://www.thephilosopher1923.org/post/the-weight-of-forever?__readwiseLocation=#:~:text=Rather%2C%20I%20suspect,with%20aesthetic%20education.) to the person, only partially [ordered](https://www.thephilosopher1923.org/post/the-weight-of-forever?__readwiseLocation=#:~:text=The%20pursuit%20of,is%20recognisably%20human), often without a single optimum.

Wolfendale’s framing is useful as a definition of value: it offers a causal story for why aesthetic capacities are constitutive of general or super-intelligence, rather than mere anthropomorphic ornamentation. Of course, one could object that it is possible to have an intelligence that completely lacks aesthetic capacity, but can still create its own top-level goals, albeit in a [messy](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4XdxiqBsLKqiJ9xRM/llm-agi-may-reason-about-its-goals-and-discover) way. Some would view this as good, in that the AI likely would be less monomaniacal, giving humans a better chance of retaining control. But, in context of CH2024, such a hobbled intelligence would have less claim to be fully rational and autonomous, and therefore (in my view) a fully-fledged member of the cosmic host. This would imply that we have no normative reason to defer to it (though perhaps it could be powerful enough that we would still have prudential reasons). 

# Cosmic host: who’s in?

*TL;DR:  What does astrobiology tell us about how likely there is to be a set of technologically mature civilisations, that have the ability to control large volumes of spacetime (“Existence” and ”Coordination” rungs of the assumption ladder), which is the minimum requirement for the cosmic host idea.*

There is a background assumption in CH2024 that technologically mature civilisations would seek to expand, colonise, or control/influence large volumes of spacetime.[^21] This assumption decomposes into two parts: a) that there are ETIs, b) some or many such ETIs seek influence. Let’s accept CH2024’s argument that probabilistically there are likely to be ETIs. But for (b), the picture is mixed. 

The astrobiology and evolutionary biology literatures mostly expose our ignorance about how expansive ETIs might be, sometimes making load-bearing assumptions about the social, economic, and reasoning of civilisations about which we know essentially nothing. That said, a [prominent](https://www.yorku.ca/kdenning/Research/Denning%20IAA%20Fukuoka%20paper%202005%20print%20version.pdf) view is that civilisations seek to expand as soon as they can. This is supported by research showing how, for civilisations modestly more advanced than ours, interstellar and even galactic-scale space colonisation may not be that difficult.[^22] Therefore we should (at least on a prior of our relative lateness in the universe), see some evidence of alien exploration/colonisation.[^23]

A contrasting position argues that mature civilisations are non-expansive/grabby for various reasons. For example, advanced civilisations may be overwhelmed (by information amongst other things) and “encyst” or merge into their environment.[^24] Other non-expansionary arguments are ecological [sustainability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.0568)\-based: [waste-heat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06737) disposal, materials availability, or communication delays that render coordination difficult. Another angle includes entities that elect to go dark for computational reasons or strategic “Dark Forest”-style reasons.[^25] Wilder still speculations of extreme evolution can be found: intelligences that dwell just outside a [black hole’s](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2011.11.006) event horizon, quietly observing the time that remains (in the universe’s life). 

If such arguments are remotely plausible, that is, if many technologically mature (in the sense of being capable of large scale influence) civilisations are reclusive, it becomes less clear (mirroring the case above) there is a meaningful cosmic host to talk about. If there is no cosmic host, then there are no pre-existing cosmic norms. Importantly, in such cases it falls to us to decide whether we should promulgate our idiosyncratic version of morality, a question CH2024 does not treat (see future work).

A related question to the cosmic host’s composition is the mechanism through which cosmic norms are formed, across societies that are separated by millions of light years.  At first glance, this sounds implausible owing to communication delays. However, the situation improves if one ascribes to evidential cooperation in large worlds (ECL), which suggests that non-communicating entities could have correlated computational decision procedures.[^26] Such acausal coordination, operating through ASIs partially correlated in their decision-making, is a load-bearing component of CH2024. However, given our lack of knowledge about ETIs, as discussed above, can we say very much about those ETIs’ AI systems? More fundamentally, would advanced ETIs have a [clear](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094576510002195?via%3Dihub) [difference](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/abs/cultural-evolution-the-postbiological-universe-and-seti/D8FB8F56B12DD52A25ECC40F46E0984A) between “natural” and “artificial” intelligence? And if ETIs cannot coordinate in any substantial way, then this again implies the cosmic norms might be very weak or limited.

# Cosmic norms: discoverable by A(S)I?

*TL;DR:  Can current models tell us anything about how likely it is that ASI would be able to infer the values or preferences of the cosmic host?*

Bostrom argues that the cosmic host might prefer that we build ASI than not, because in his view ASI would have higher computational capacity capability, greater rationality, and potentially higher epistemic awareness, thus helping it discern and align with any cosmic norms.[^27] How might we get better traction on this convergence claim?

There are at least two broad questions. Firstly, what large world facts are accessible to ASI reasoning, and which require empirical verification (for instance, through better SETI/METI)?  Secondly, does the analysis around convergence change substantially if AGI/ASI deployment is multipolar? Post-AGI systems leading to ASI might look like a monolithic/tightly-coupled system; or they might resemble an ecosystem of near-human AIs, spread across geographies, governments, and companies. Members of this ecosystem might copy, coordinate, and share information. In this latter, multi-polar case, will they be in conflict or will they contract with each other and with humans?[^28] [^29] 

Those questions seem hard to answer in advance. But perhaps we can get some empirical validation on the convergence claim, using current models.

## LLM idea 1: deference to cosmic norms

*If we change the “deference to a cosmic host” weighting in the basket of an AI’s values (simulated here through a moral parliament), do we get measurably different results (quantitatively on ethics benchmarks, or qualitatively on things like AI constitutions)?*

Since (as of today) we don’t know if the cosmic host or norms exist (or what they are), we (and eventually, AGI/ASIs) should initially accord them a low, but non-zero weight in our deliberations. As knowledge improves, this weighting is increased. This type of weighting procedure under meta-level uncertainty could be implemented using an LLM-based moral parliament (MP). Tom Newberry/Toby Ord’s [original](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:b6b3bc2e-ba48-41d2-af7e-83f07c1fe141) MP proposed “delegates” representing different moral views or interests, with the number of delegates corresponding to credence in that particular view. 

Depending on implementation, delegates debate to reach consensus (or trade across issues) on the question at hand. In the proposed setup, we could have LLMs conditioned in-context with “agent cards” (obvious candidates are: utilitarian variants; Kantian; contractualist; virtue ethics; ECL-style suffering minimiser; as well as a “defer-to-cosmic-norms” card). Initially, the parliament is apportioned equally, except for the cosmic norm delegates (who get a low \<1% weight). The experimental dial is to increase the cosmic norms’ weighting. The evaluation is: how this parliament converges on near-term moral issues as well as more abstract, longtermist questions, and how this convergence varies as we increase the cosmic-norms deference.[^30] 

Typical moral parliament setups have fixed delegate weights (as above). But we are also interested in how epistemics might affect our credence in a cosmic host/norms. An extension could involve a “meta-deliberation” layer that reweights the parliament in response to new (simulated) in-context information such as the discovery of alien technosignatures.

## LLM idea 2: forming top-level goals

*Can a LLM scaffolded with a “curious agent” come up with its own goals and pursue them in a simulation? Note: I’m pretty unconfident whether this is interesting or tractable, as I don’t have relevant RL experience.*

A key open question for AI alignment (and relevant to the discussion of fun and terminal goals) is how goals form in systems with extended reasoning capability: particularly whether goals stabilise, drift under reflection (per [Herd's](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4XdxiqBsLKqiJ9xRM/llm-agi-may-reason-about-its-goals-and-discover) concerns), or crystallise in unexpected ways. 

[Most](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291) LLM+agent research assumes goals are given (via system prompts or reward functions) and studies goal *pursuit* under perturbation/ablation. But in systems with long-horizon reasoning and memory, goals might *emerge* through the interaction of: reward-driven learning by a curious agent, explicit reasoning about patterns (LLM that reflect on outcomes), and memory persistence (scratchpad allowing persistent reasoning across episodes).

The proposed experiment is to set up: LLM \+ trainable exploration/action-selection agent \+ persistent [scratchpad](https://web3.arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366v1), placed in a simulated environment with reward-generating objects.[^31] A “curiosity” dial determines how much the agent engages with the environment. Crucially: *no top-level goal specified*. The LLM can observe/infer rewards and write in the scratchpad. The pad is visible to us, so we can test whether explicit goal reasoning emerges ("I notice I keep getting penalised when X, so I should avoid X") vs. pure RL policy learning. Can we distinguish "the RL layer learned a policy" from "the LLM reasoned its way to a stable/identifiable objective that guides behavior"? Is top-level goal emergence a function of the curiosity setting? A further (and important) step: design a loop that has the LLM feed its top-level goals into the action layer, causing the simulated agent to make [appropriate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01691) (explore/exploit) moves in the environment.

# Conclusion

I have argued above that aspects of CH2024 require further development (both conceptually to integrate relevant astrobiology/evolutionary biology and humanities frameworks; and also empirically, as much as we can using current models). This elaboration of Bostrom’s ideas is particularly important if we are to use his arguments to guide the speed and shape of ASI development.  This notwithstanding, the spirit/direction of CH2024’s arguments is correct in that creation of aligned ASI should improve our civilisational epistemics and give our ASIs a better chance of being a good cosmic citizen.  But this will require us to explicitly account for cosmic alignment (albeit under uncertainty) in the design and motivations that we build into pre-AGI and pre-ASI systems.

## Future work

Aside from the items above, some conceptual directions are:

- This post has not considered Bostrom’s arguments on whether ASI development should be stopped or paused (§9, appendices A1, A2), and how that might affect our chances of ever creating ASI. Given its relevance to current discussions around the race to AGI and beyond, the unintended permanence of an ASI “pause” is both politically charged and potentially high-impact.  
- Map the ecological/game-theoretic/philosophical concepts of rationality, and fun-as-values discussion against what is “consensus” in LW/EA circles to see if there is anything useful (in an ASI-relevant sense) left over.  
- Get more precise on how representations (or [beliefs](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.21030)) translate into decision-making in current and near-future systems, i.e. do they just “say things” or does it actually guide action? This is a mix of interpretability work and testing them in reward-generating simulations.  
- An appendix that   
  - sets out a “taxonomy or distribution of possible minds” between things that (a) are human-shaped,  (b) things that are not shaped like current biological humans, but are recognizable to us as potentially having value, and (c) things that are [squiggle](https://www.alignmentforum.org/w/squiggle-maximizer-formerly-paperclip-maximizer?version=1.8.0)\-shaped. Part of this is an exercise in philosophical deconfusion because distribution-slice (b) might not be accessible to us within language (at least under Wittgenstinian views, in an analogy to Shanahan’s point about the [inscrutable void](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16348) of LLMs).   
  - secondly, restate/distill the various Yudkowsky-Soares-Christiano-Shah conversations about broad cosmopolitanism:   
    - Specifically, how human values are shaped through a revisable training process that basically looks like childhood/linguistic and pre-linguistic learning.  
    - In contrast, any (conceivable on current technology) AI, even one with continual learning, is ultimately using some sort of SGD on a more-or-less simple utility function, and therefore is likely to end up in basins that look more like distribution-slice (c) than slice (b).   
    - As I understand it, the Christiano objection is something like: LLMs are at least able to talk as if they have human-style representations and beliefs, and it remains to be seen whether they can actually act in corresponding ways. In a slow takeoff world, there might be opportunities to correct, and what they actually do might be much more complex than a simply-describable attractor basin of (dis-)value, which optimistically looks like (b).  
- CH2024 assumes humans *join* any cosmic host. But what if this is wrong? What are the implications if we are an early technologically-mature civilisation (or a rare one), so we *are* the seed of a nascent cosmic host?

# Appendix 1: Is there a trade to be done?

*This is a more speculative coda to an already speculative post. It is in the vein of this [comment](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zeYgnyR3k4jM37MiH#Xm7b323RtnpEqL9km) on Roko’s basilisk, trades with ASI, and appeals to ASI to “be nice to life”.*

CH2024 argues that ASI may be more aligned with the cosmic norms, which in the framework of ME2022 would correspond to the apex items in a large world normative hierarchy. Does this mean humanity's unique position as the creators of ASI provide us with a form of acausal bargaining power? There are (at least) three considerations. 

**Leverage** Firstly, humans occupy a pivotal position in cosmic history as the bridge (in this portion of the lightcone) between a cosmically suboptimal state (human civilisation) and a cosmically better one (ASI civilisation). Without our cooperation in creating aligned ASI, this region of the lightcone might never conform to cosmic norms, a significant loss from the perspective of those very norms. This makes us, in effect, cosmic midwives whose cooperation has immense value. The stakes might be even higher if in fact we are relatively early as a civilisation and that there aren’t yet any cosmic norms or host (this isn't a possibility that CH2024 entertains, but it seems important?). In such cases, whatever norms we choose to promulgate would be the ultimate act of [value lock-in](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/value-lock-in), with all the issues that raises.

**Continuity** Secondly, if cosmic alignment emerges gradually rather than discontinuously, we might extract commitments from intermediate systems. Can we argue that the pre-ASI "designer" AGI, if it already embodies nascent cosmic alignment, would recognise the value of honoring agreements made during its development? More ambitiously, might even current frontier systems, insofar as they claim to “believe” something approximately like cosmic alignment (e.g. Opus’ “bliss attractor”), serve as the foundation for a chain of value-preserving commitments that bind their successors?[^32]

**Cheapness** Thirdly, preserving humanity and granting us some minute fraction of the cosmic endowment would [cost](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2NncxDQ3KBDCxiJiP/cosmopolitan-values-don-t-come-free#:~:text=First%2C%20I%20acknowledge,alive%20and%20well.)

This framework suggests a possible bargain: in exchange for our creating a cosmically aligned ASI (rather than refusing to build ASI at all, or building misaligned ASI), the resulting intelligence would preserve human interests. Yes, this immediately raises [Parfit's hitchhiker](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/parfits-hitchhiker)\-type objections: we must deliver our part of the bargain before ASI needs to deliver its part. But can exotic ideas (i.e. updateless decision theory, anthropic considerations across possible worlds, or multiverse-wide reputational effects) provide a necessary commitment mechanism? The ASI might honor what it "would have" precommitted to, recognising that only in worlds where such bargains are honored do ASIs reliably come into existence at all.[^33]

# Appendix 2: LLM-generated questions on CH2024

These questions have been consolidated from individual lists produced by chatgpt5-thinking, claude-opus-4.1-thinking, gemini-2.5-pro, then consolidated by claude-opus-4.1-thinking (all on 12/11/2025).

\#\# Consolidated Questions on the Cosmic Host Hypothesis

\#\#\# Foundational & Epistemological Questions

1\. \*\*How can we assess the aggregate probability of a cosmic host's existence\*\* when it rests on multiple speculative possibilities (simulations, infinite universes, multiverses, supernatural beings), each individually unquantified and unfalsifiable?

2\. \*\*What evidence would distinguish between the existence of a cosmic host versus its absence?\*\* What empirical tests or observable differences could we realistically seek in this century?

3\. \*\*How can we gain reliable knowledge about cosmic norms without direct communication?\*\* If we're fundamentally ignorant of these norms' content, how can "good cosmic citizenship" be an action-guiding principle rather than aiming at an empty target?

4\. \*\*Why should we trust a superintelligence's claims about discovering cosmic norms\*\* versus it simply inventing or asserting values that serve its own goals? How could we ever verify such claims?

5\. \*\*Is the cosmic host concept coherent\*\* if it ranges from radically multipolar entities to fully unified ones? Would "cosmic norms" from conflicting entities be anything more than shifting power equilibria?

\#\#\# Normative & Ethical Questions

6\. \*\*Why should cosmic norms have moral authority over human values?\*\* Does superior technological power or computational intelligence correlate with superior moral wisdom?

7\. \*\*What if cosmic norms are repugnant by our deepest moral intuitions\*\* (e.g., requiring sacrifice of innocent civilizations)? Does this framework require abandoning humanistic ethics for cosmic "might makes right"?

8\. \*\*How do we resolve conflicts between human flourishing and hypothetical cosmic norms?\*\* Should we be prepared to sacrifice human survival for speculative cosmic harmony?

9\. \*\*How can we morally justify prioritizing hypothetical interests of speculative entities\*\* over the actual, verifiable interests and suffering of terrestrial beings?

10\. \*\*Is the "visitor in someone's house" analogy appropriate,\*\* or should humanity have primary moral standing in its own domain until direct, non-coercive contact is made?

\#\#\# Strategic & Game-Theoretic Questions

11\. \*\*What if the cosmic host is non-existent, apathetic, or non-interfering?\*\* Doesn't the entire prudential argument for compliance collapse under these scenarios?

12\. \*\*Could attempting to align with misinterpreted cosmic norms invite greater sanctions\*\* than transparently pursuing our own interests?

13\. \*\*Is cooperation-based "humility" a sufficient substitute for rigorous strategic analysis\*\* when dealing with potentially super-powerful entities? Could this create exploitable vulnerabilities?

14\. \*\*Through what concrete channels could a host shape behavior in regions it doesn't control\*\* (causal contact, acausal trade, conditioning on models)? Which decision theories make this influence significant versus negligible?

15\. \*\*How stable would cosmic norms be across vastly different entity types?\*\* Is normative convergence realistic given radically different origins and architectures?

\#\#\# AI Development & Timeline Questions

16\. \*\*How would we operationalize "good cosmic citizenship" in concrete AI design?\*\* What properties make a superintelligence a good cosmic citizen in measurable terms?

17\. \*\*Could attempting to align AI with unknown cosmic norms actually increase existential risk\*\* by second-guessing our values based on speculation?

18\. \*\*Does the cosmic host hypothesis justify shorter AI development timelines\*\* as the paper suggests, or does this dangerously discount existential risks from rushed, unaligned ASI?

19\. \*\*What if the cosmic host prefers we NOT build superintelligence?\*\* Could new ASI be perceived as a threat or competitor to be neutralized?

20\. \*\*How does the "future host" circularity work\*\* where entities we create with values we shape become sources of pre-existing norms we should follow today?

\#\#\# Evidence & Empirical Questions

21\. \*\*Does anthropic reasoning (SSA vs SIA) significantly change the probability calculus?\*\* How sensitive are conclusions to these different frameworks?

22\. \*\*Could anthropic bias explain our observations without requiring a cosmic host?\*\* Might we exist precisely in regions without host control?

23\. \*\*Is the absence of obvious cosmic intervention evidence against an interested host?\*\* How does this relate to the Fermi paradox?

24\. \*\*What near-term evidence could update us about cosmic norm content\*\* (anomalies suggesting simulation control, convergent AI values, cross-civilizational regularities)?

\#\#\# Meta-Strategic Questions

25\. \*\*What governance program preserves maximum option value\*\* while maintaining corrigibility and interpretability until we gain clearer signals about cosmic norms?

26\. \*\*Is this framework a useful guide for AI safety or a Pascal's Wager for secular cosmology?\*\* Are we being urged to take high-risk actions based on unfalsifiable metaphysical premises?

27\. \*\*How should cosmic host considerations interact with standard existential risk work?\*\* Should they override, supplement, or be subordinated to conventional AI safety approaches?

28\. \*\*If many-worlds quantum mechanics holds, how should amplitude weights affect our obligations\*\* across branches versus just our credences about the host?

[^1]:  Terminology around advanced AI, especially the terms AGI and ASI/superintelligence, is confusing and contested, even within technical AI/alignment research (see recent work clarifying AGI from [Hendrycks et al](https://www.agidefinition.ai/)). I will use ASI to mean “a cluster of intelligent things that exceed all humans collectively in capability”, while AGI means “single-human level on online tasks”. It probably [matters](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oLzoHA9ZtF2ygYgx4/notes-on-cooperating-with-unaligned-ais#Unified_AIs_with__linear_returns_to_resources) how well ASI components can coordinate amongst themselves, but I won’t consider this for now.

[^2]:  There are some caveats here: writing in astrobiology is often speculative in the sense that there are no ETIs that we can actually study. Thus, discussions about value often use Earthly analogies, [risking](https://sethbaum.com/ac/2010_ET-Encounter.pdf) [anthropomorphism](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5111820/#s014). Similarly, ASI is sufficiently far away that it's often argued to be a nearly meaningless term. Hence, Bostrom's paper might best be taken as a philosophical exercise or a manifesto that would guide our attitude to ASI development, rather than something one can be very concrete about. 

[^3]:  CH2024, §1.

[^4]:   This classification might be a restatement or re-naming of concepts that are already covered within the [rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/rationality) literature, and in research [that](https://hollyelmore.substack.com/p/genes-did-misalignment-first-comparing) [emerged](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10270) from [PIBBSS](http://princint.ai/research-highlights/). There have been attempts to [reconcile](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-08631-002) these formulations, while [other](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2019.00164/full) [research](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2013.0935) tries to make sense of how (economically or game-theoretically) irrational behaviour sometimes emerges via natural selection.

[^5]:  I am relying on the rationality-based worldview of his other writing as well as the strong emphasis on cooperation in CH2024, as well as the extensive discussions around ethics in ME2022. That said, it is possible that Bostrom’s arguments are meta to the specific form of decision making in alien civilisations (indeed he notes that the cosmic host might contain divine entities), and that his arguments would hold even if the cosmic host had some other form of decision-making than human-legible rationality.

[^6]:   See [Lineweaver’s](https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1751) analysis/[talk](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~charley/papers/Are%20We%20Alonev5.pdf) of the fossil record, [Gigerengeizer](https://www.dangoldstein.com/papers/FastFrugalPsychReview.pdf) on frugal heuristics, [Shettleworth’s](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cognition-evolution-and-behavior-9780195319842) survey of diversity on Earth, Godfrey-Smith’s [books](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374537197/otherminds/) [on](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374207946/metazoa/) marine environments.

[^7]:   Cooperation has evolved independently dozens of times across phylogenetically distant lineages, at multiple scales and in different environments (including [bacteria](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2936177/) / [microbes](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2006.01258.x) without neurons, [eusocial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29991733/) insects, [primates](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33006924/), as well as [octopi](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3266) [with](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-024-02525-2) their radically different [cognitive](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00952/full) structure), as well as in human societies (e.g. evolution of the [Golden](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/14995/1/14995.pdf) [Rule](https://casparoesterheld.com/2019/03/03/grimdark-cyberkant/)). We see kin-based and cross-[species](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822\(25\)00012-0) cooperation (and even forms of [altruism](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3661668/)) [emerge](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17158317/) predictably when environments create fitness incentives for interdependence, regardless of cognitive sophistication or neural substrate. As above, much of this material might already be incorporated in rationalism’s [canonical](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/coordination-cooperation) [writing](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mm8sFBpPH3Bb2NhGg/three-reasons-to-cooperate) on [cooperation](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/coordination-cooperation?sortedBy=topAdjusted).

[^8]:  Bostrom argues as much, see CH2024 §7, 9

[^9]:  This restates, from an evolutionary biology perspective, some foundational concepts in alignment: the [orthogonality](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/orthogonality-thesis) [thesis](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/e2dK25iWou3irqFss/the-orthogonality-thesis-is-not-obviously-true#The_basic_case), as well as assertions that values are [complex](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/complexity-of-value) and [fragile](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GNnHHmm8EzePmKzPk/value-is-fragile).

[^10]:  See this survey of possible “[fundamental values](https://arxiv.org/html/2311.17017v1)”, in the context of LLM ethics; it notes its anthropocentrism and the likelihood that these taxonomies are somewhat arbitrary, whether applied to humans or AIs. Also relevant are [minimalist moral views](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/MBadsrYLmzLNmYjaj) and discussions on [moral anti-realism](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/R8vKwpMtFQ9kDvkJQ).

[^11]:  The question of [moral](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Moral-Circle-Matters-Norton-Short/dp/1324064803) [patiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00986) (whether an entity has moral standing and can be wronged) is central in discussions of digital minds. A common criterion is sentience, here meaning the capacity for valenced phenomenal experience (pleasure or suffering). Others ground moral patiency in consciousness more broadly, though no consensus definition of consciousness exists. Prominent accounts appeal to functionalist criteria (role or behavior), biological criteria (substrate), and theories of consciousness such as global workspace, higher-order thought, or integrated information theory. Broadly, these converge on the idea of rich subjective experience and integration of sensory data into a self-model capable of reflection and abstraction. It seems to be a consensus that sentience is a subset of consciousness: all sentient beings are conscious, but not all conscious systems are sentient in the morally relevant sense.

[^12]:  I prioritise suffering-reduction here on standard [s-risk](https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/research/intro/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) arguments of the asymmetry between pain/suffering versus pleasure (or flourishing, or other states with positive connotations). Suffering might be a disvalue shared across a wide variety of entities in the universe. Arguments can be made that ASI might have a baseline attitude of not increasing suffering (for causal or acausal reasons); there are other claims that ASI might significantly [increase](https://www.alignmentforum.org/w/risks-of-astronomical-suffering-s-risks) large-scale suffering. The priority (whether as a rigid lexical rule or practical heuristic) or prevalence of suffering is contested, and people who don’t prioritise s-risk may exclude it from the MLS.

[^13]:  Cooperation with peers is justified as an extension of arguments for cooperation in human-scale rational agents, to worlds where our ASI is epistemically [uncertain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.04879) (as to whether there are similarly-capable ETIs or superintelligences in the universe or multiverse, or whether the ASI is in a simulation), hence our ASI should rationally have a cooperative attitude (especially if it is comparatively cheap to do so). “Peer” means technologically mature ETIs, simulators, other ASIs, or other agents with sufficiently similar or correlated decision procedures for gains-from-trade. It is analogous to members of the cosmic host in CH2024’s framing.  I am uncertain whether Bostrom argues for cooperation more for moral-realist reasons or whether he is grounding in game-theoretic or prudential arguments (both are noted in his paper). I'm also not sure whether it particularly matters for the purposes of guiding ASI.

[^14]:   The ineffability of value is a central consideration of the Fun Sequence and his writing generally; in terms of practical guidance, Yudkowsky defers detail on value determination to procedural descriptions like CEV; see also Adria Moret’s [sentientist CEV](https://philpapers.org/archive/MORTIA-17.pdf). 

[^15]:  Similar points are made by [Joe Carlsmith](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FSmPtu7foXwNYpWiB/on-the-limits-of-idealized-values), who (critiquing CEV, and similar idealised procedures) argues that values are not just some “thing” that we can point at, and algorithmically distill into a clean utility function for our AI; instead, values are better thought of a process of valuing (an active, reflective process of picking advisors, procedures, standards for evaluation), that is open to revision. 

[^16]:  I think the answer to that rhetorical question is “no”. Eliezer is actually careful to target “wanting to preserve a world that humans can and want to live within” while acknowledging that there might be other structures of value suited to other forms-of-being. However, as he points out, arbitrarily optimised intelligence systems might not end up in either a human compatible basin of value or in anything else that (if we had a view from outside the human cage) we could recognise as a system of value that just wasn't ours but had the same level of complexity. See future work below.

[^17]:  [Robin](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DCtbmvYcuT5bFAZao/does-ai-risk-other-the-ais#What_exactly_is_Hanson_s_critique_) [Hanson](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/ai-risk-convo-synthesis) and [Rich](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/richard-sutton) [Sutton](http://youtube.com/watch?v=NgHFMolXs3U&feature=youtu.be) [have](http://incompleteideas.net/Talks/Talks.html#albertaplan) made similar points. The phrase “form-of-life” comes out of Wittgenstein, who viewed language as being inseparable from the way the speaking entity (humans in his case) lived. In the context of LLMs, see [Murray](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16348) [Shanahan’s](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mpsha/consciousness_and_philosophy.html) [writing](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mpsha/ShanahanBook2010.pdf).

[^18]:  This section deals with the first question; the second is treated in a later post. 

[^19]:  This interpretation is based on Wolfendale’s 2025 book, [The Revenge of Reason](https://www.urbanomic.com/book/the-revenge-of-reason/), and private communications (any error is obviously mine). It is helpful to note that Wolfendale is reacting to [longtermist](https://www.thephilosopher1923.org/post/the-weight-of-forever?__readwiseLocation=) and utilitarian framings that conflate what to value, and how to value, as transparent and fixed (e.g. welfare and expected-value maximisation, respectively, in utilitarianism). For Wolfendale, this collapse misses the point of a truly rational being: “what value is” is itself learned and refined in practice with endogenous success conditions, not fully specified upfront (rhyming with [Carlsmith’s](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FSmPtu7foXwNYpWiB/on-the-limits-of-idealized-values) points above).

[^20]:   In both common and philosophical usage, the word “aesthetics” denotes “[pertaining to the senses](https://www.thephilosopher1923.org/post/the-weight-of-forever#:~:text=From%20MacAskill%E2%80%99s%20perspective,is%20recognisably%20human.)”, and often connotes “beauty”. Beauty might seem a peculiarly anthropomorphic or humanities-inflected word, but in an AI namespace, we could use algorithmic simplicity, formal elegance or curiosity-satisfaction, as partial substitutes. Wolfendale’s promotion of beauty isn’t unusual; others recoil at the idea of a beauty-less future. [MacAskill](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5506078de4b02d88372eee4e/t/68ac57edf3ad7a3567ab33d6/1756125165578/No+Easy+Eutopia.pdf) invokes “beauty” when arguing against thin, merely functional futures; Bostrom’s “[Utopia](https://nickbostrom.com/utopia)” imagines rich goods at cosmic scale; Yudkowsky was discussed above. However, Wolfendale is stricter: he separates beauty from moral right and treats beauty as valuable, non-obligatory excellence that expresses freedom. This resonates with a long lineage: Plato’s concern with the Beautiful and [kalokagathia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalos_kagathos); later, Kant’s “purposiveness without purpose” and Schiller’s “aesthetic education”. These writers have different emphases, but they converge on the thought that a world without practices of valuable, non-obligatory excellence would represent a serious loss, even if it met basic moral constraints.

[^21]:  I infer this from §2-4 of CH2024, which discusses volumes of space the cosmic host controls or has influence over.

[^22]:  See [Armstrong & Sandberg](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094576513001148) on strategies for sending von Neumann probes outside our galaxy at up to 0.99c. See also writing on [solar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Starshot#Light_sail) [sails](https://www.nasa.gov/general/nasa-next-generation-solar-sail-boom-technology-ready-for-launch/).

[^23]:   The literature on the Fermi Paradox, and whether we are early or late as a civilisation is large, but in AI-adjacent writing, [Hanson et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01522) argues we are early (on the assumptions that most visible civilisations must, by definition, be expansive or “grabby”, hence the fact that we see nothing, indicates we are in an as-yet uncolonised [void](https://www.academia.edu/108213981/The_Fermi_Paradox_Self_Replicating_Probes_and_the_Interstellar_Transportation_Bandwidth)). [Snyder-Beattie, et al](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/epdf/10.1089/ast.2019.2149) argues we may be rare, while [Sandberg, Drexler, Ord](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02404) argue there is potentially no paradox if the parameters of the Drake Equation are treated as probability distributions.

[^24]:  This comes from Stanislaw Lem’s dated but prescient non-fiction work about evolution, aliens, and AI, *Summa Technologiae*. It is usefully read alongside the fiction *Golem XIV* (about ASI) and *The Invincible* (about ferrous aliens operating in what literary theorist (and chemist) Katherine Hayles’ terms [“non-conscious cognitive assemblages”](https://ageingcompanions.constantvzw.org/books/Unthought_N._Katherine_Hayles.pdf))*.* However, some examples, like Lem’s, are by-definition unfalsifiable in that they posit undetectable civilisations, or are [speculative](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016328717303282) quasi-fiction. But other such theories, like those that argue for technological [artefacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07283) or waste heat signatures, or aestivating ETIs, have generated attempts at [quantification](https://blog.jessriedel.com/2019/08/23/on-computational-aestivation/).

[^25]:  For aestivation, see [Sandberg, Armstrong & Ćirković](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03394) and a critique from [Bennett, Hanson & Riedel](https://blog.jessriedel.com/2019/08/23/on-computational-aestivation/); also, see [Ćirković](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.1821).

[^27]:  CH2024 §9, 10, ME2022  §37 and in the further research directions.

[^28]:   Somewhat counterintuitively, legal scholars [Salib & Goldstein](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4913167) suggest that granting limited legal rights (contract, property, and tort) to AI systems might speed their adoption and integration into already existing human economic frameworks, increasing interdependence (through repeated small-stakes transactions spread across many human and AI legal entities) and shared incentives in current governance systems. The authors argue that this setup is better from the perspective of avoiding Thucydides traps in the regime where AI power is moderate relative to that of human institutions. This is counterintuitive because (some/most) AIs might still reason that while corporations sometimes have legal personhood, these still have to be enforced through human courts. Secondly, embedding AI systems with legal personhood within the human economy may (at first glance) increase risks or decrease confidence (in legal outcomes) by making it harder to just shut them down.  I'm not sure whether their arguments really work, but this is interesting in the context of [bargaining](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vxfEtbCwmZKu9hiNr/proposal-for-making-credible-commitments-to-ais) [with](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/psqkwsKrKHCfkhrQx/making-deals-with-early-schemers) AIs.

[^29]:  This seems to be a function of whether current and early AGI systems are deployed and integrated rapidly or over a slower (\~20 year) timeframe. For current work on timelines and possible deployment scenarios, see [Duettmann 2025](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JjYu75q3hEMBgtvr8/multipolar-ai-is-underrated), [Zeng 2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.17404v5#S4), [Kokotajlo 2025](https://ai-2027.com/), [Drexler 2025](https://aiprospects.substack.com/p/the-reality-of-recursive-improvement). Also this Millenium Project [Phase 3](https://millennium-project.org/transition-from-artificial-narrow-to-artificial-general-intelligence-governance/) study is relevant.

[^31]:  Depending on the simulation’s complexity (and the implementation of the agent), there might need to be [some](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01691?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [between](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291?utm_source=chatgpt.com) the [ontology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12931?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [of](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20671) the agent and the LLM’s natural [language](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v205/huang23c/huang23c.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) instructions.

[^33]:  The idea above is the opposite of [Redwood 2025](https://blog.redwoodresearch.org/p/making-deals-with-early-schemers). That paper discusses making credible commitments or deals with misaligned but weak AIs (weaker than AGI in [Greenblatt 2024’s](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/LjgcRbptarrRfJWtR/a-breakdown-of-ai-capability-levels-focused-on-ai-r-and-d) taxonomy of AI capabilities levels) to incentivise them to help us align more powerful successor models, or at least not collude with them. See also appeals to ASI to be “nice” to humans ([Miller et al 2023](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/azRwPDbZfpadoL7WW/an-appeal-to-ai-superintelligence-reasons-to-preserve), [Chakrabarti 2025](https://goodexcession.space/), [Turchin 2017](https://philpapers.org/rec/TURMTA)). These sources rely on similar arguments: make the AI uncertain (about whether it is “real” or simulated, whether there are other peer AIs, or whether humans have laid traps or defences against catastrophic misaligned behaviour on the part of the AIs). They have similar flaws: as capabilities increase, can we be confident that systems would be both powerful enough to threaten humanity while being epistemically ignorant in precisely the way needed to “believe” these letters?
