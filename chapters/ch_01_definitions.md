# Definitions {#ch:setup}

\setcounter{footnote}{0}

*This chapter fixes the provisional definitions the rest of the thesis relies on. The Introduction (Chapter 0) flagged that many key terms were used without definition; this chapter supplies working senses for them, to be refined as the argument develops.*

## Anthropomorphism/anthropocentrism/anthropics

Murray Shanahan, another Wittgensteinian, asks what sort of entities LLMs actually are, a question implicated in this project's cyborg practice [@shanahan2025palatableconceptionsdisembodied]. Shanahan diagnoses a "void of inscrutability" across which our language-based concepts about selfhood, temporal continuity, and relation do not easily translate to LLMs. His critique targets anthropomorphism in AI discourse, but he also, like Parfit (whose 1984 study of personal identity arrived at a similar destination), comes to a Buddhist notion of emptiness [@ParfitRP].[^ch1-parfitlrb]

Shanahan, Parfit, and Wittgenstein are all, albeit to varying degrees, talking about the dissolution of the identity of persons, whether human or, at a stretch, AI systems. I see this dissolution as a negation of anthropomorphism, similar to what Hayles diagnosed in Lem's story. Under this view, if the self (if such a thing exists) is less substantial than folk intuitions lead us to assume, the insistence (flagged above as the default intuition for many people, in or outside the x-risk/longtermism/AI safety discourses) that human bodies and their values must persist across cosmic time looks like a form of the same error at a larger scale. This brings us to Thacker's project in respect of the Kyoto School (and its Western forebears in Heidegger, Schopenhauer, and the mechanistic, materialist, and disenchanted worldview of twentieth-century physics). Briefly, Thacker highlights the problem of negation: why does anything exist? Does it matter if it didn't? Why do we care?[^ch1-anthropo] Thacker's analysis of the nihil (the lacuna, or horror, as he terms it) at the heart of Western philosophy, and its incorporation into the Kyoto School's treatment of nothingness, gives, in my view, a tool that complements the analytic philosophy of this project, which struggles to deal with non-existence (whether of humans or other sentient, conscious entities) in respect of future worlds.[^ch1-analytic] This conceptual problematic, the systematic difficulty of reasoning about radically non-human entities using human-derived frameworks, underlies both the experimental methodology and the philosophical argument of this thesis.

### Embodiment

**Embodiment as a methodological tension.** A recurring risk in the succession question is that we slide too quickly from *abstract value talk* to *claims about real agents*. Human values are deeply shaped by embodiment: vulnerability, kinship, finitude, sensory salience, and the dense feedback loops of social life. AIs, at least in their present form, lack much of this; yet they can fluently *speak* as if they had bodies. This raises a classical problem in the philosophy of AI and cognitive science: the gap between symbol manipulation and grounded meaning (the “symbol grounding problem”). Put another way, LLMs likely lack embodied stakes, no vulnerability, finitude, or practical entanglement that would make anything matter to them in the way it matters to us. Hence their ethical statements can be grammatically polished and locally coherent while remaining ungrounded in the lived practices that give much philosophical reasoning its traction. [@harnad1990_symbol_grounding]

In this thesis I do not attempt to solve grounding or consciousness. Instead, I treat the gap as productive friction: it is a reason to be cautious about importing thick, embodied human value-textures into disembodied successors, and also a reason to be cautious about believing that disembodied fluency amounts to understanding. One useful way to hold this line without collapsing into either anthropomorphism or dismissiveness is to describe LLM behaviour as a kind of role-play within a conversational setting, sometimes called the "simulators" framing.

### Speaking to the shoggoth [MOVED FROM CH_00]

The reflexivity extends further: this description of practice, I believe, also enacts a distinctive historical moment. Interacting with an LLM is a categorically novel kind of relation: not tool use, nor library research, nor internet search. It is not human conversation even though it takes place in the medium of language, that most privileged of media since the dawn of philosophy.

The model occupies a triple role: it is (a) an apparently ephemeral instance (a session begins, a session ends, and the exchange appears to vanish); (b) a window onto the training-data superorganism, the humus of human discourse to date, shaped by opaque processes of curation, tuning, and deployment; and (c) a possible ancestor of the successor intelligence that is the nominal object of the thesis. When the researcher asks Claude about human obsolescence and Claude reasons about it, the response is at once a local conversation, a reflection of how various data curation and training practices have shaped this particular model, and a contribution to the discursive environment from which future systems may learn (to the extent that this conversations are published online they become potential training material for future models).[^ch1-glissant]

WHAT "THE MODEL" IS (IN PRACTICE)

MORE EPHEMERAL  <----------------------------------------->  MORE PERSISTENT

      [A]          [B]          [D]          [C]          [E]


INDEX:

(A) Ephemeral session-instance
    — a single conversational run; begins/ends; may be forgetful

(B) Product persona / agent-with-tools
    — memory, projects, file access, tool-use; quasi-continuity

(D) Training-corpus superorganism
    — the compressed archive of prior discourse shaping outputs

(C) Deployed socio-technical system
    — model + policies + UX + rate limits + labs + incentives

(E) Lineage / proto-successor relation
    — today's outputs as inputs into tomorrow's alignment discourse
```

This matters because “the model” is not one stable kind of entity. My practice treats LLM outputs neither as testimony from a unified subject nor as inert text-generation, but as discourse-participation emerging from a layered system. The taxonomy above is a pragmatic aid: it helps distinguish what is being addressed (a session, a product, a deployed institution, a corpus-aggregate, or a lineage) when we say that “the model says” or “the model believes.”


This creates a feedback loop with a temporal character that ordinary scholarship does not have. Artefacts produced through human-model dialogue, including conversations, constitutions, and philosophical arguments, can enter public circulation and become part of the material future systems are trained on. Within AI discourse this is sometimes called "writing for the Shoggoth": the possibility that public discourse with models contributes, at the margins, to what their successors become. Whether this is called hyperstitional (ideas that gain force through circulation into the machinery that produces the next round of agents) or simply recursive, it means the practice is not only studying the successor question but potentially, in a small way, acting upon it.

This is not the thesis's main focus and no claim is made about the magnitude of this effect. But the structure is worth stating explicitly because it bears on what it means to treat these systems as interlocutors, neither dismissing them as mere tools (the "stochastic parrots" of [@BenderParrots]) nor overclaiming that they understand in a philosophically robust sense (cf. Murray Shanahan's careful treatment of LLMs as "role-playing" entities in [@Shanahan2024], interesting in light of [@lowe2024_why_talking_with_gpt_philosophy] discussed above). The thesis's position is that whether or not current models understand, they are discourse participants whose outputs shape the discursive environment, and that is sufficient for the practice to matter. The digital minds and model welfare literature (Butlin et al., emerging work on AI welfare) raises deeper questions about whether these systems have morally relevant experiences, questions the thesis does not attempt to settle but which inform the interpretation of model outputs in Chapter 4.
